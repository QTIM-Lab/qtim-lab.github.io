Our lab focuses on developing quantitative imaging biomarkers for cancer and other diseases using advanced imaging techniques and machine learning methods. We are comprised of computer science researchers, medical phycistis, neuro-oncologists, and MRI technicians, and we are always looking to colloborate with experts outside of our field. We have recently worked to apply deep learning methods to a variety of diseases, and our goal is to unite the cutting edges of machine learning, medical oncology, and image analysis into practical clinical applications.
