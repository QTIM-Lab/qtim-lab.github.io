<h1>Elizabeth Gerstner</h1>
<h2>Neuro-Oncologist, Massachussetts General Hospital</h2>
<p>I am a Neuro-Oncologist with an interest in incorporating imaging techniques into clinical trials to better understand tumor biology and response to treatment. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and spending time with my husband and twin daughters. <a href="mailto:EGERSTNER@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/7244>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer</h1>
<h2>Neuro-Oncologist, Massachussetts General Hospital</h2>
<p>My reasearch lies at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, informatics, image acquisition and analysis with a goal towards clinical translation. I am an electrical engineer by training, having receied a B.Tech in EE from IIT Bombay and a PhD in EE from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. After a number of years in the semiconductor industry, I returned to academia following a MS in Biomedical Informatics from OHSU.<br /><br />
My current projects include quantitative imaging in cancer, image analysis and decision support for retinal imaging, cloud computing, mathematical modeling of drug delivery in cancer, crowd sourcing and challenges,  algorithm development and deep learning.<br /><br />
Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with family, photography, tennis and occasionally rock climbing. <a href="mailto:kalpathy@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayashree-kalpathy-cramer-0ab6315/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/8165>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>Yi-Fen Yen</h1>
<h2>Assistant Professor, Harvard Medical School</h2>
<p>I am an MRI physicist and my expertise is in MRI pulse sequence design and pharmacokinetic modeling. My research focus is on MR quantitation of micro-environment for brain tumor imaging. My work involves optimization of MRI pulse sequences and clinical protocols, development of imaging biomarkers for drug delivery and treatment monitoring, quantitation of cell abnormalities using MR diffusion, perfusion and spectroscopy techniques, and cross-modal comparison of MRI to PET, CT and Optical Imaging.
 </br></br>
My second area of research interest is hyperpolarized 13C metabolic MRI. In the past few years, my work involved the design of new MRSI pulse sequences, polarized 13C-probe development and pharmacokinetic modeling of metabolic conversion. Majority of my hyperpolarized 13C research was conducted pre-clinically, on animal models of prostate cancer, brain tumors, liver cancer, cardiac disorder, renal function, and arthritis.
 </br></br>
My early research involved the subjective experience of pain using fMRI, BOLD deactivation by cross-modal stimuli, quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) for tumor assessment, caffeine effects on BOLD and CBF, and fMRI in stroke and epilepsy patients. <a href="mailto:YYEN1@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-fen-yen-6a181224//>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/3589446>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>James Brown</h1>
<h2>Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Martinos Center @ MGH</h2>
<p>James studied computer science and biomedical imaging at the University of Birmingham (UK). His interests include image registration, segmentation, shape analysis and deep learning. Outside of work he enjoys bouldering, playing board games and making noise on a guitar (and more recently, a ukulele). <a href="mailto:jbrown97@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-brown-a241138b/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>Ina Ly</h1>
<h2>Neuro-Oncology Fellow, Massachusetts General Hospital</h2>
<p>I'm a Neuro-Oncology Fellow interested in using novel imaging techniques to study brain tumor biology, with the goal of translating these into clinical practice to help with diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Prior to joining QTIM, I completed my clinical training in Neurology at the University of Washington and in Neuro-Oncology at MGH/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, running, and reading crime novels. <a href="mailto:ILY@PARTNERS.ORG">Email</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>Artem Mamonov</h1>
<h2>Research Assistant, Martinos Center @ MGH</h2>
<p>I am a web developer and data scientist at Martinos Bioimaging Center and I work on building web applications for running, visualization, evaluation, and optimization of medical image analysis algorithms in the cloud. I love messing around with modern JavaScript and UI libraries like React, D3, and Node and Material Design. I also like exploring deep learning algorithms for building medical decision tools for doctors. <a href="mailto:AMAMONOV@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-mamonov-68369820/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/3555840>Martinos Center Page</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>

<h1>Andrew Beers</h1>
<h2>Research Assistant, Martinos Center @ MGH</h2>
<p>Andrew studied icebergs, phytoplankton, and sustainable architecture for an Environmental Studies degree at Brown University, but then abandoned all of that to work on quantitative tumor imaging and deep learning at QTIM instead. Inside of the lab, he's interested in dynamic contrast MRI, comparing and benchmarking radiomics software, and creating open-source deep learning tools for the medical imaging filed. Outside of the lab, he volunteers at a local progressive bookstore, watches basketball, and hikes in the Adirondacks. <a href="mailto:abeers@mgh.harvard.edu">Email</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewlbeers/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href="#Top">Back to Top.</a></p>
